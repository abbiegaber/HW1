<a id = "about"></a><h3> About Me </h3>
<p>I am currently a student at the University of Iowa, studying Organizational Management and MIS. I am expected to graduate this upcoming summer, August of 2013. Currently, I work at the department store Von Maur in Southeastern Iowa City. After graduation, however, I hope to get a job as a Business Analyst.
<br /> <br />
I was born in Cheyenne, Wyoming and have moved around the midwest throughout my life. I grew up in the Denver Metro Area of Colorado, before moving to Dubuque in 2005. I began attending the University of Iowa in 2010, after graduating from Hempstead High School in Dubuque, and moved to Iowa City permanently the next year.
<br /> <br />
While growing up, I was in several different sports. I competed in gymnastics, track, volleyball, and soccer. Before quitting gymnastics, I was the State All-Around winner for my age range--but was forced to quit after injuring my back. I also played several instruments, including violin, guitar, and piano. 
<br /> <br />
I have two cats--a black cat named Gidgette and a grey, tiger-striped cat named Andie. Growing up, I had two pet fox terriers (dogs) named Max and Belle. I love animals, and have been a vegetarian for 7 and a half years.
